|Display real time list of running processes with their CPU load.

|*diag log device*
|Shows how much space is used by each device  logging to the Fortianalyzer, including quotas.

|*exe iotop -b -n 1*
|Display and update every 1 second READ/WRITE statistics for all the processes.


|*diagnose system print cpuinfo*
|Display hardware CPU information - vendor, number of CPUs etc.

|*diagnose hardware info*
|Even more hardware-related info.

|*diagnose system print df*
|Show disk partitions and space used. Analog of the Linux `df`.

|*exe lvm info*
|Shows disks status and size

|*diagnose system print  loadavg*
|Show average system load, analog to the Linux `uptime` command.

|*diag log device*
|Shows how much space is used by each device  logging to the Fortianalyzer, including quotas.

|*diagnose fortilogd lograte*
|Show in one line last 5/30/60 seconds rate of receiving logs.

|*diagnose fortilogd lograte-adom all*
|Show as table log receiving rates for all ADOMs aggregated per device type (i.e. rate for all Fortigates will be as one data per ADOM).
