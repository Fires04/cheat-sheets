=== General Health
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description


|*get sys status*
|Get general information: firmware version, serial number, ADOMs enabled or not, time and time zone, general license status (Valid or not).

|*get sys performance*
|Detailed performance statistics: CPU load, memory usage, hard disk/flash disk used space and input/output (`iostat`) statistics.

|*exe top*
|Display real time list of running processes with their CPU load.

|*diag log device*
|Shows how much space is used by each device  logging to the Fortianalyzer, including quotas.

|*exe iotop -b -n 1*
|Display and update every 1 second READ/WRITE statistics for all the processes.


|*diagnose system print cpuinfo*
|Display hardware CPU information - vendor, number of CPUs etc.

|*diagnose hardware info*
|Even more hardware-related info.

|*diagnose system print df*
|Show disk partitions and space used. Analog of the Linux `df`.

|*exe lvm info*
|Shows disks status and size

|*diagnose system print  loadavg*
|Show average system load, analog to the Linux `uptime` command.

|*diagnose system print  netstat*
|Show established connections to the Fortianalyzer, as well as listening ports. Every logging device can (and usually does) have multiple connections established.

|*diagnose system print  route*
|Show routing table of the Fortianalyzer.

=== Communication debug
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*diagnose test application oftpd 3*
|List all devices sending logs to the Fortianalyzer with their IP addresses, serial numbers, _uptime_ meaning connection establishment uptime, not remote device uptime, and packets received (should be growing).



|*diagnose debug application oftpd 8 <__Device name__>*

*diagnose debug enable*
|Real time debug of communicating with the __Device name__ device.

|*diagnose sniffer packet any "host __IP of remote device__"*
|Sniff packets from/to remote device, to make sure they are sending each other packets. The communication is encrypted.

|*diagnose sniffer packet any "port 514"*
|Sniff all packets to/from port 514 used by Fortianalyzer to receive logs from remote devices.

=== Logs from devices
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*diagnose test application oftpd 50*
|Show log types received and stored for each device.


|*diag log device*
|Shows how much space is used by each device  logging to the Fortianalyzer, including quotas.

|*diagnose fortilogd lograte*
|Show in one line last 5/30/60 seconds rate of receiving logs.

|*diagnose fortilogd lograte-adom all*
|Show as table log receiving rates for all ADOMs aggregated per device type (i.e. rate for all Fortigates will be as one data per ADOM).

|*diagnose fortilogd lograte-device*
|Show average logs receive  rate per device for the last hour, day, and week.

|*diagnose fortilogd lograte-total*
|Show summary log receive rate for all devices on this Fortianalyzer.
