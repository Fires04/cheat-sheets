= MRV Optiswitch OS904 OS906 OS912 debug and diagnostic commands
Yuri Slobodyanyuk


*MRV Communications* (acquired in 2017 by ADVA Optical Networking) is an Israeli company known for their optical network equipment, most notably their Optiswitch Carrier Ethernet Switch series. The switches (OS904, OS906G, OS912) are not available for purchase from them anymore, but if you work for a telco company, you surely still have these boxes around doing their work.

Unfortunately, with the merger and the end of sale, all the documentation disappeared as well. To help you a bit I bring below some debug and diagnostic commands to be run on the CLI. You can still find the datasheet here https://www.cornet-solutions.co.jp/pdf/mrv_os_900_sdb_a4_hi.pdf
