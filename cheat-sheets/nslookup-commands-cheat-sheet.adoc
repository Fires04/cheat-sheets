|Command
|Description

|*nslookup*
|Enter the interactive mode. The nslookup prompt `>` opens.

|*set all*
|Show current settings for the session, useful to show what the `nslookup` is actually going to do on the next query.

|*set norecurse*
|Disable recursive querying. Useful when checking if a specific DNS can answer the query without recursively asking other DNS servers. Use `set recurse` to enable it back.

|*set ty=_Record-type-to-query-for_*
|Sets the record `type` you want to query. E.g. `set ty=MX` - all following queries will ask for MX record only, until changed again with `set ty=...`. Available types A, AAAA, ANY, MX, TXT, SOA, CNAME, etc. as per DNS protocol. The default type, if not set otherwise is A/AAAA.

|*_domain_*
|Query the domain _domain_ for the value of the record type set previously via `set ty=...` or A record by default.

|*server [_IP-address-of-alternative-DNS-server_]*
a|Run by itself, `server` prints DNS server(s) currently set and used for resolving. Change the DNS server to query by specifying IP address of the server, e.g. 

----
> server 8.8.8.8
Default server: 8.8.8.8
Address: 8.8.8.8#53
----

|*set debug/nodebug*
|Enable verbose output of what the `nslookup` is actually doing (*debug*), or disable *nodebug* (default). Shows what server is being queried, additional records, whether the server is authoritative or not. 

|*set no<name of the option>* 
|Unset any option you previously set. E.g. to disable recursive query: `set norecurse`. There is no space between the "no" and the option name. Use `set <option name>` to enable the option again.

|*IDN_DISABLE*
a|Environment variable, if not set (default) enables querying IDN names, e.g.:

----
> set ty=A
> рег.рф
Server:         8.8.8.8
Address:        8.8.8.8#53

------------
    QUESTIONS:
        рег.рф, type = A, class = IN
    ANSWERS:
    ->  рег.рф
        internet address = 194.58.116.37
        ttl = 21600
    AUTHORITY RECORDS:
    ADDITIONAL RECORDS:
------------
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   рег.рф
Address: 194.58.116.37
----

|*set port=_N_*
|Set port different from 53 on the remote DNS server. NOTE: `nslookup` does NOT support DOT/DOH protocols, only plain old clear text DNS.

|*exit*
|Leave `nslookup` interactive mode to the command line of terminal.

|WINDOWS only: 
*ls -d* _domain-name_
|Try to do AXFR zone transfer from the configured DNS server. If works and unintended - serious security risk. Linux version of nslookup does NOT have this option. E.g. `ls -d yurisk.info`.
