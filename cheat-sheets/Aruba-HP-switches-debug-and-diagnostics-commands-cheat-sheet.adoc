NOTE: All commands were tested on HP/Aruba 5400 switches (specifically 5406Rzl2), but will work on any model with recent firmware versions (16.x or newer), except for the hardware features unavailable on smaller models, like VSF .


== General Health
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*show cpu [_seconds_]*
|Show CPU stats of average load for 1 second, 5 seconds, and 1 minute, optionally setting period in _seconds_ (300 is max).

|*show uptime*
|Show uptime of the switch since reboot, for VSF stacked switches shows uptime for each member.

|*show time*
|Show switch time and date, for log correlation.


|*show flash*
| Show what firmware images are stored in the flash, and which one is the primary/secondary for the next boot.

|*show redundancy*
|In VSF stack topology, shows firmware image version of each member, as well as the number of failovers.

== Logs
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

a| Logs category:

* W=Warning   
* I=Information
* M=Major     
* D=Debug 
* E=Error
| All logs are categorized when written, and the category is presented in the 1st column of each log. This also
allows filtering logs for display by their category, see below.


| *show logging -r*
| Show system logs and events in reverse chronological order, i.e. newest logs first.

|*show log -a*
|Show logs from previous boot cycles. HP/Aruba will display only logs since the last boot, by default, but you can add `-a` to any of the log display commands below to work on previous logs as well. 

|*show log _string-to-search_*
|Search and display only logs containing the specified string. The search is *case sensitive*, and no regex - just plain strings with exact match. E.g. to search for logs   containing  the interface _1/B2_: `show log 1/B2`; to search for all bgp-related logs like peer up/down: `show log -r bgp`.

|*show log command [-a]*
|Show log of commands issued by users on CLI. This log is NOT erased even by 
the `clear log` and records all commands - both configuration and not. So, it will record commands like `ping 8.8.8.8`, `clear log`, `no router bgp`. Adding `-a` will show logs from previous boot cycles.

|*show log -m/-e/-p/-w/-i/-d*
|Show only logs of the specified category, see above for the available categories.

|*clear log*
|Delete (almost) all logs.

|*show log -s*
|Display logs from the Standby commander/member in a VSF stack.

|*show log -b*
|Show logs with time since boot instead of date/time format.
|===





== Interfaces
[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description 

|*show interface status*
| Show list of all interfaces with info for each: state (Up/Down), Actual Speed, Tagged or not, VLANs configured for the interface (single VLAN for Untagged, `multiple` for Tagged). NOTE: In Cisco world Tagged interface is called *trunk*.

|*display interface [_name_]*
|Show detailed information of an interface: media type, speed/duplex state, MAC address, up/down, max frame size, VLAN id if any untagged set and `.` (dot) for 
multiple tagged VLANs, input/output erros, buffer failures, CRCs, runts. 

|*conf t*

*int _name_*

*disable/enable*
|Disable/enable a specific interface (in Cisco world `shut`/`no shut`)

|*show interface transceiver [_name_] [detail]*
|Info on installed optical transceivers: Port number where installed, Type/Speed, Serial Number. If _detail_ is added, will also show temperature, voltage, Transmit (TX) and Receive (RX) power in mW and dBm.

|*show ip*
| Show all configured IP addresses on a switch.

|*show name*
|Lists all interfaces with their names if set. In Cisco it would be `show int description`

|*show trunk*
| Show trunk interfaces with their state and type. NOTE: In HP/Aruba world *trunk* means aggregated interfaces (LAG), what in Cisco world is called port/ether-channel.

|*show trunk-statistics <trunk name>*
| Show cumulative statistics for the trunk interface: packets passed, bytes received, drops if any.

|*show lacp*
|Show LACP state on the trunking interfaces.
