== Controlling scripts themselves

|Command
|Description

|*rem*
|Comment, till the end of line. It can be used to comment out a whole line or part of it.

|*cls*
|Clear the screen buffer.

|*echo _text to display_*

*echo off/on*

*echo.*
|Print text on line, or, with `off/on` switch without text, turn off/on echoing the commands being run. 
Usually, you set `echo off` as the 1st line in a batch script, and the `echo on` as the last line. Turning
echoing off does not hide _output_ of the commands run, just the commands themselves. The 3rd option is `echo` followed immediately
by _dot_ and it causes echo to print a blank line (an dthis is the only way to do so).

|*@*
|Turn off echoing only for the command preceded by this @. Usually, also used as `@echo off` to prevent the _echo off_ 
being printed itself.

|*title _Title bar text_*
|Change the title of the cmd.exe window for this session. As a rule of a good style, change _title_ on each stage of the 
script, to let users know what the script is doing.
