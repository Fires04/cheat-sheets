= Linux ip route command reference by example

NOTE: All the commands below take effect immediately after you hit Enter, and do NOT survive reboot. You may shorten the commands to the shortest but unique, e.g. `sh ip ad` instead of `show ip address`. All the commands come as part of the pre-installed package `iproute2`.
