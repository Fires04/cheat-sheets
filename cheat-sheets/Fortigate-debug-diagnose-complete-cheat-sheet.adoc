= Fortigate debug and diagnose commands complete cheat sheet
:homepage: https://yurisk.info
:toc:

Author: Yuri Slobodyanyuk, https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurislobodyanyuk/


NOTE: To enable debug set by any of the commands below, you need to run *diagnose debug enable*. This is assumed and not reminded any further.

NOTE: To disable and stop immediately any debug, run *dia deb res* which is short for *diagnose debug reset*.

NOTE: All debug will run for 30 minutes by default, to increase use `diagnose debug duration <minutes>`, setting to 0 means unlimited by time. Reboot will reset this setting.







== Security rulebase debug (diagnose debug flow)
.Security rulebase diagnostics with `diagnose debug flow`
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*diagnose firewall iprope lookup <src IP> <src port> <dst IP> <dst port>
<IANA protocol number> <src interface>*
|Policy lookup for any combination of IPs and ports - use to see what policy (if
any) matches traffic between specific IP addresses and ports. E.g. `dia firewall
iprope lookup 10.10.10.1 34567 8.8.8.8 443 6 LAN1`

|*diagnose debug flow filter*
|Show the active filter for the flow debug

|*diagnose debug filter clear*
|Remove any filtering of the debug output set

|*diagnose debug flow filter <filtering param>*
| Set filter for security rulebase processing packets output. You can set multiple filters - act as AND, by issuing this command multiple times. Parameters:

`vd` - id number of the vdom. When entering the vdom with `edit vdom`, this number is shown first.

`vd-name` - limit debug to specific VDOM by its name. Fortigate translates the name to VDOM ID (`vd`).

`proto` - Protocol number.

`addr` - IP address of the packet(s), be it a destination or/and a source.

`saddr` - IP source address of the packet(s).

`daddr` - IP destination address of the packet(s).

`port` - Source or/and destination port in the packet(s).

`sport` - Source port of the packet(s).

`dport` - Destination port of the packet(s).

`negate <parameter>` - negate the match, i.e. match if a packet does NOT contain  `<parameter`. Where `parameter` is one of the above: `vd`, `addr`, `saddr`, `port`, `sport`, `dport`

|*diagnose debug filter6 <parameter>*
| Same as `diagnose debug filter` but for IPv6 packets. The rest of matching and conditions remain of the same syntax.

|*diagnose debug flow show function-name enable*
|Show function names responsible for each step in processing.

|*diagnose debug flow trace start [number]*
|Actually start the debug with optional `number` to limit number of packets traced.

|*diagnose sys top [_refresh_] [_num-of-processes_] [_iterations_]*
|Print list of running processes updated every _refresh_ seconds (default 5), for
_iterations_ times, sorted in descending order by the CPU load. This `top` command does not display all processes by
default, to show them all, set _num-of-processes_ to high number, for example
100. Press "m" to sort the processes by memory consumption. The displayed table
is in this order: `Process id`, `process state: (R)unning, (S)leep, (Z)ombie,
(D)isk Sleep, < Means higher priority`, `CPU used`, `Memory used`.

|*dia sys kill _signal-id_ _process-id_*
|Forcefully kill the process with the id of _process-id_, sending it the given _signal-id_ (Linux signals, e.g. 9, 11).

|*get sys session-info ttl*
|Show the default TTL setting for the connections in the table, default being 3600 seconds.

|*diagnose sys session filter <filter parameter> <filter value>*
| Set filter to show/manipulate only specific connections in the stateful table. Run without any filter parameters this command displays the current filter applied if any. Parameters: 

`vd` - id number of the vdom. When entering the vdom with edit vdom, this number is shown first.

|*diagnose sys ha checksum show <__VDOM__/global>*
|Print detailed synchronization status for each configuration part. Use after seeing `out-of-sync` in *diagnose sys ha checksum cluster* to know which part of configuration causes members to be out-of-sync.

|*diagnose sys ha checksum show <__VDOM__/global> <settings part name>*
|Show exact setting inside the settings tree that causes out-of-sync. Use output from *diagnose sys ha checksum show* (see above) for _settings part name_. E.g. if `diagnose sys ha checksum show root` indicates that _firewall.vip_ is out-of-sync, running `diagnose sys ha checksum show root firewall.vip` will give checksums of each VIP in the root domain to compare with those of secondary member.


|*diagnose debug app hatalk -1*
|Enable heartbeat communications debug. It shows in real time if members are talking over sync interfaces. 
The output will look like `state/chg_time/now=2(work)/1610773657/1617606630`, where the desired `state` is _work_, _chg\_time_ is last cluster state/failover date in epoch, and _now_ is the last time communication occurred on heartbeat interface(s), also in epoch. 

|*diag debug application hasync -1* 
|Real time synchronization between members. As only things that changed get synchronized after 1st sync is established, may take time to produce output. See next.

|*execute ha synchronize stop*

*diag debug enable*

*diag debug application hasync -1*

*execute ha synchronize start*

|Stop, enable debug, then start again HA synchronization process, will produce lots of output.


|*exe ha manage ?*

== SIP ALG and helper
.SIP proxy or helper debug
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*config sys settings*

*get \| grep alg*

|Show the current SIP inspection mode. If the output is `default-voip-alg-mode: proxy-based` then the full Layer 7 
proxy SIP inspection is on (_ALG_ inspection). If the output is `default-voip-alg-mode: kernel-helper-based` then the Layer 4 _helper_ inspection is on. In both modes Fortigate does IP address translation inside SIP packets (if needed), and opens dynamically high ports for incoming media/voice streams ports. In _ALG_ mode, the Fortigate additionally does RFC compliance verification and more. So, the _ALG_ mode is more prone to cause issues but also provides more security.

|*show system session-helper \| grep sip -f*
|If using SIP _helper_ and not _ALG_, make sure there is an entry for SIP in the helpers list, usually on port 5060, but may be custom as well.
