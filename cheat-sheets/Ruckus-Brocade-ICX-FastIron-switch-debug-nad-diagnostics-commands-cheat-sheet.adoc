NOTE: When in doubt, use Cisco IOS-like commands, as most are equivalent.

|Command
|Description

|*show version*
|Show the switch hardware version, whether stack or not, uptime, serial number, firmware version. 

|*show flash*
|Show boot images stored in the flash - primary and secondary boot images and thier versions, flash free space. 

|*show dir* OR *show files*
|List contents of the flash - in addition to boot images, also startup configuration file and anything else stored in the flash.

|*show boot*
|Show in what sequence boot images will be tried on reload, usually Primary then Secondary.

|*show cpu tasks*
|Show last 1 second CPU load per task in percents. 

|*show cpu histogram waittime*  AND *show cpu histogram holdtime*
|Shows the task CPU usage in each bucket. This includes how many times a task run time or hold time falls in each bucket, and the maximum run time and total run time for each bucket. Hold time - The time that the task is holding the CPU without yield. Wait time - The time that the task is waiting for execution.

|*show fdp neighbor* AND *show fdp neighbor detail*
| Show CDP or/and LLDP neighbors, provided any of these protocols are enabled on the switch.

|*show run*
|Show the running configuration.

|*show statistics brief*
|Show stats for all interfaces - cumulative packets in/out, error in/outs.

|*show statistics ethernet <port number>*
|Show detailed statistics for the interface _<port number>_ - packets/bytes in/out, bad packets/frames, CRC count, Collisions, Interface bandwidth utilization in percents, current interface utilization in bits/sec.

|*show spanvlan <vlan number>*
|Show spanning tree status (optionally) for a given VLAN - who is root, interface cost, state (forwarding, disabled) of each interface. 

|*show vlan <vlan number>*
|Show VLAN information - spanning tree status (on/off), SPT priority, which ports are tagged and which are not, Uplink ports if any.

|*show inline power*
|Show power over the Ethernet status for each interface, if enabled/supported.

|*show int <interface name>*
|Detailed interface statistics like `show int` in Cisco equipment - port uptime, MAC address, configured vs actual speed/duplex, MDI mode, STP state, input/output rate in bits/sec,
