:homepage: https://yurisk.info


NOTE: To enable debug set by any of the commands below, you need to run *diagnose debug enable*. This is assumed and not reminded any further.

NOTE: To disable and stop immediately any debug, run *dia deb res* which is short for *diagnose debug reset*.

NOTE: All debug will run for 30 minutes by default, to increase use `diagnose debug duration <minutes>`, setting to 0 means unlimited by time. Reboot will reset this setting.


== Security rulebase debug (diagnose debug flow)
.Security rulebase diagnostics with `diagnose debug flow`
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*diagnose debug flow filter*
|Show the active filter for the flow debug

|*diagnose debug filter clear*
|Remove any filtering of the debug output set

|*diagnose debug flow filter <filtering param>*
| Set filter for security rulebase processing packets output. You can set multiple filters - act as AND, by issuing this command multiple times. Parameters:

`vd` - id number of the vdom. When entering the vdom with `edit vdom`, this number is shown first.

`vd-name`

`proto` - Protocol number.

`addr` - IP address of the packet(s), be it a destination or/and a source.

`saddr` - IP source address of the packet(s).

`daddr` - IP destination address of the packet(s).

`port` - Source or/and destination port in the packet(s).

`sport` - Source port of the packet(s).

`dport` - Destination port of the packet(s).

`negate <parameter>` - negate the match, i.e. match if a packet does NOT contain  `<parameter`. Where `parameter` is one of the above: `vd`, `addr`, `saddr`, `port`, `sport`, `dport`

|*diagnose debug filter6 <parameter>*
| Same as `diagnose debug filter` but for IPv6 packets. The rest of matching and conditions remain of the same syntax.

|*diagnose debug flow show function-name enable*
|Some

|*diagnose debug flow trace start [number]*
|Actually start the debug with optional `number` to limit number of packets traced.

|*diagnose vpn tunnel list [name <Phase1 name>]*
| Show operational parameters for all or just specific tunnels: Type (dynamic or static), packets/bytes passed, NAT traversal state, Quick Mode selectors/Proxy Ids, mtu, algorithms used, whether NPU-offloaded or not, lifetime, DPD state. 

|*get vpn ipsec tunnel details* 
| Detailed info about the tunnels: Rx/Tx packets/bytes, IP addresses of the peers, algorithms used, detailed selectors info, lifetime, whether NAT Traversal is enabled or not.

|*get vpn ipsec stats tunnel*
| Short general statistics about tunnels: number, kind, number of selectors, state

|*get vpn ipsec tunnel summary* 
| Short statistics per each tunnel: number of selectors up/down, number of packets Rx/Tx.


|*get vpn ipsec stats crypto*
| Crypto stats per component (ASIC/software) of the Fortigate: encryption algorithm, hashing algorithm. Useful to see if unwanted situation of software encryption/decryption occurs.

|===
|Command
|Description

|*get router info kernel*
a|View the kernel routing table (FIB). This is the list of resolved routes actually being used by the FortiOS kernel.

`tab` Table number, either 254 for unicast or 255 for multicast.

`vf` Virtual domain index, if no VDOMs are enabled will be 0.

`type` 0 - unspecific, 1 - unicast, 2 - local , 3 - broadcast, 4 - anycast , 5 - multicast, 6 - blackhole, 7 - unreachable , 8 - prohibited. 

`proto` Type of installation, i.e. where did it come from: 0 - unspecific, 2 - kernel, 11 zebOS module, 14 - FortiOS, 15 - HA, 16 - authentication based, 17 - HA1

`prio` priority of the route, lower is better.

`pref` preferred next hop for this route.

`Gwy` the address of the gateway this route will use

`dev` outgoing interface index. If VDOMs enabled, VDOM will be included as well, if alias is set it will be shown.
