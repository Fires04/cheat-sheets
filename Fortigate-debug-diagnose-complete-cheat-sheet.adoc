|*get vpn ipsec stats tunnel*
| Short general statistics about tunnels: number, kind, number of selectors, state

|*get vpn ipsec tunnel summary* 
| Short statistics per each tunnel: number of selectors up/down, number of packets Rx/Tx.

| Show all routes advertised by us to the specific neighbor. 

|*get router info bgp neighbors <IP of the neighbor> routes*
