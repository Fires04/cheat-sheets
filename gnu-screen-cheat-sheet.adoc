2+|*Sharing session (e.g. for pair programming)*


[cols="1,1"]
a|Original session (say _user1_):

. Set suid root bit on `screen` binary: `chmod +s /usr/bin.screen` 
. Inside session you want to share: `C-a :` then `multiuser on` to enable sharing session.
. Add usernames to share the session with: `C-a :` `acladd <username>`

Connecting user (say _user2_):

. Run in shell: `screen  -x  <sharing username>/`, in our example `screen -x user1/`

|Sets up sharing the session. Another user connecting to the session views real-time its output, can enter and run commands himself. Also see *aclchg*, *acldel*, *aclgrp* for controlling what the connecting user can and cannot do. 

|*C-a **
| See who is connected to your shared screen session.
