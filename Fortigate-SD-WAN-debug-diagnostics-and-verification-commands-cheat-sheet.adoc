|Command
|Description

|*diagnose sys sdwan health-check* (6.4 and newer)

*diagnose sys virtual-link  health-check* (5.6 up to 6.4)     

| Show state of all the health checks/probes. Successful  probes are marked `alive`, failed probes are marked `dead`. Also displays `packet-loss, latency, jitter` for each probe. 

|*diagnose sys sdwan member* (6.4 and newer)

*diagnose sys virtual-wan-link member*

|Show list of SD-WAN zone/interface members. Also gives each interface gateway IP (if was set, 0.0.0.0 if not), `priority`, and `weight` both by default equal `0`, used with some SLA Types. 

|*diagnose sys sdwan service* (6.4 and newer)

*diagnose sys virtual-wan-link service*

|List configured SD-WAN rules (aka `services`), except the Implied one which is always present and cannot be disabled, but is editable for the default load balancing method used. Shows member interfaces and their status `alive` or `dead` for this rule. 



|*diag sys sdwan  intf-sla-log <interface name>*  (6.4 and newer)

*diag sys virtual-wan-link intf-sla-log <interface name>*

|Print log of <interface name> usage for the last 10 minutes. The statistics shown in bps: `inbandwidth`, `outbandwidth`, `bibandwidth`, `tx bytes`, `rx bytes`. 


|*diag netlink interface clear <interface name>*

|Clear traffic statistics on the interface, this resets statistics of the SD-WAN traffic passing over this interface. Needed, if, for example, you changed SD-WAN rules, but not sure if it's already active. E.g. `diag netlink interface clear port1`. 


|*diagnose firewall proute list*
|List ALL Policy Based Routes (PBR). SD-WAN in Fortigate, after all, is implemented as a variation of PBR. This command lists manual (classic) PBR rules, along with SD-WAN created via SD-WAN rules. *Important*: Manually created PBR rules (via `Network -> Policy Routes` or on CLI `config route policy`) always have preference over the SD-WAN rules, and this command will show them higher up.
