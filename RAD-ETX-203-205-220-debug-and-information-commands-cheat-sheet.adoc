= RAD ETX 203, 205, 220 debug and information commands
Author: Yuri Slobodyanyuk, admin@yurisk.info

Carrier Ethernet Devices by RAD (ETX-203AX, ETX-203AM, ETX-203AX-T, ETX-205A, ETX-220A) are quite popular with telco companies around the world for connecting end clients to the backbone at layer 2. And while reference documentation is available, I couldn't find the debug/information commands digest on the Internet at all. This post, I hope, comes to fill the gap.

The commands below are meant to be run on the device CLI itself, not on provisioning system of some kind. I show examples of using them below as well.

|Command
|Description


|*show configure port summary*
| Show port summary: state (up/down), speed

|*show config port _name_ status*
| Show port status: administrative and operational states, speed/duplex, connector type, MAC address, and most important (for fiber) - RX/TX signal power (dBm)

|*show config port _name_ statistics*
| Statistics of the port: total bits/frames passed,maximum/minimum bits/sec seen, and most interesting - CRC errors, error frames, oversize frames, discards.

|*show config port _name_ statistics*
| Statistics of the port: total bits/frames passed,maximum/minimum bits/sec seen, and most interesting - CRC errors, error frames, oversize frames, discards.

|*config port name*  

*rate-measure interval _seconds_*  

*show rate*
| Show port utilization in bits/sec in real-time


|_Responder:_

*config flow*  

*service-ping-response local-ip 13.13.13.2/30 next-hop 13.13.13.1 egress-port ethernet 4/2 vlan 777*

_Ping sender:_

*config flow*

service-ping local-ip 13.13.13.1/30 dst-ip 13.13.13.2 next-hop 13.13.13.2 egress-port ethernet 4/1 vlan 777 number-of-packets 10 payload-size 1450

|Send ping over the client vlan (here 777) from ETX to ETX to measure latency and packet loss. You configure one ETX as responder and another one as sender.

|*show configure flows summary brief*
|List all flows configured on this ETX briefly

|*show configure flows summary details*
|List all flows configured on this ETX with details

|*show config system system-date*
| Show system time of the appliance, important for logs/alarms correlation.

|*show config reporting brief-alarm-log*
|Show alarms log, their severity/state/last raised time
